## Setup

1. Install c# development IDE of your choice. Rider or Visual Studio are common options.

2. Download latest [Megadot](https://megadot.megacrit.com/) or Godot of equivalent version (currently still compatible)
3. Download latest .pck and .dll of [BaseLib](https://github.com/Alchyr/BaseMod-StS2/releases) and copy to `Slay The Spire 2/mods`. You may have to create this folder.
4. Download entire template project and load as a template in Rider (From step 7 (here)[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Install_custom_project_templates.html#create-custom-project-template]), 
   or get template from NuGet with `dotnet new install Alchyr.Sts2.Templates@1.0.0`. The github project will likely be slightly more up-to-date.
5. Create new solution using template. Make sure not to put any spaces in the project name, and enable `Put solution and project in same directory`.
6. Update filepaths at the top of the `.csproj` file. Select the project
<img width="251" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9fbc231-da1d-46a7-8f36-b6c5b4bb1369" />
and press F4 to open it in Rider. In Visual Studio you should be able to open the .csproj file directly.

## Publish/Build:
Right click the project and choose "Publish". Publish options can be left as default. This project is set up for Publish to compile your code and also the Godot .pck, then copy these files to the Slay the Spire 2 mods folder.

If you only make code changes, you can Build instead. This will only generate your code `.dll` and copy it over to the mods folder, but not the `.pck`.
